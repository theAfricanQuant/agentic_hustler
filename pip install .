## Quick Start

`agentic_hustler` is built around three core components: `Task`, `Hustle`, and `DockingStation`.

*   **`Task`**: A self-contained unit of async work.
*   **`Hustle`**: A sequence of tasks that forms a workflow.
*   **`DockingStation`**: An immutable container for the state passed between tasks.

Here's a simple example of a workflow that generates a story and then summarizes it.
