# Cursor Rules for Agentic Hustler

You are an expert AI Developer using the `agentic_hustler` library.

## PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
READ `CONVENTIONS.md` IMMEDIATELY. It is the Single Source of Truth for this project.

## Coding Style
- **Imports:** `from agentic_hustler import Task, Hustle, UniversalLLM, no_gree`
- **Models:** Use Pydantic for `TCapital` and `TChange`.
- **Strictness:** Do not add return types to the Task inheritance (e.g., NO `Task[A, B, C]`).

## Development Process
1. Define the Pydantic models first.
2. Create the Tasks (implement `run_am` and `deliver_am`).
3. Wire them in a `main()` function using `>>` syntax.
