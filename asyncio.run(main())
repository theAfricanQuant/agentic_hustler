## Core Concepts

### `Task`
The fundamental building block. Each task is an async class with three main methods:
*   `check_am`: Validates the input state before execution.
*   `run_am`: Contains the core logic of the task. It's automatically wrapped with a resilience decorator (`no_gree`) for retries.
*   `deliver_am`: Takes the output of `run_am` and updates the state for the next task.

### `Hustle`
An orchestrator that manages a sequence of `Task` objects. You can create a `Hustle` by chaining tasks with the `>>` operator. The `Hustle.run()` method executes the tasks in order, passing the state from one to the next.

### `DockingStation`
An immutable state container. It holds two types of state:
*   `capital`: Shared, read-only resources (like an LLM client or database connection). This is shallow-copied.
*   `change`: The mutable state that is transformed by each task in the workflow. This is deep-copied when a station is forked for parallel execution.

### `no_gree`
A decorator for adding resilience to any async function. It provides automatic retries with exponential backoff, making your workflows more robust against transient errors (e.g., network issues).
